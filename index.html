        <h1>Explore The Space</h1>
        <p>Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are celestial bodies that orbit stars outside our solar system. The discovery of these planets has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, revealing a vast array of planetary systems with diverse characteristics.

            Since the first confirmed detection of an exoplanet in 1992, thousands have been discovered, showcasing a variety of sizes, compositions, and distances from their host stars. Some are gas giants, akin to Jupiter, while others are rocky, like Earth. The study of exoplanets has opened exciting possibilities for finding habitable worlds and even extraterrestrial life.
            
            Researchers use various methods to detect exoplanets, including the transit method, which observes dips in a star's brightness as a planet passes in front of it, and the radial velocity method, which measures the star's wobble caused by a planet's gravitational pull.
            
            As technology advances, missions like the James Webb Space Telescope are set to deepen our exploration, allowing scientists to analyze the atmospheres of distant exoplanets for signs of habitability. The quest to understand exoplanets not only enriches our knowledge of planetary systems but also brings us closer to answering one of humanity's most profound questions: Are we alone in the universe?</p>

            <h1>Milky Way Galaxy</h1>
            <p>The Milky Way Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy that is home to our solar system.<br>
            It is estimated to contain between 100 to 400 billion stars and is approximately 100,000 light-years in diameter. <br>
            The galaxy is structured with a central bulge of older stars surrounded by four major arms that spiral outwards:
            <br> the Perseus, Scutum-Centaurus, Carina-Sagittarius, and Orion arms.</p>
